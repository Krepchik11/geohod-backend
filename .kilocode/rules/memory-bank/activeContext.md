# Active Context: Geohod Backend

## Current Work Focus

The Geohod backend project is currently in active development with a focus on enhancing the v2 API implementation and improving system reliability. The team is working on completing the migration from v1 to v2 endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.

### Recent Changes

1. **API Versioning Implementation**
   - Completed implementation of v2 API controllers for all major entities
   - Established clear separation between v1 (legacy) and v2 (current) endpoints
   - Implemented consistent response patterns across v2 APIs

2. **Notification System Enhancement**
   - Implemented outbox pattern for reliable notification delivery
   - Added TelegramOutboxMessage entity for tracking notification status
   - Created TelegramOutboxProcessor for asynchronous notification handling

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Enhanced Telegram authentication validation
   - Improved CORS configuration for production environments
   - Added method-level security annotations to sensitive operations

4. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added new tables for notification processing tracking
   - Implemented proper indexing for frequently queried fields
   - Updated Liquibase changelogs for version control

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 weeks)

1. **Complete v2 API Migration**
   - Finalize remaining v2 endpoints that are still using v1 implementations
   - Update API documentation for all v2 endpoints
   - Implement deprecation warnings for v1 endpoints

2. **Notification System Testing**
   - Comprehensive testing of the outbox pattern implementation
   - Load testing for notification processing under high volume
   - Error handling and retry mechanism validation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization for slow-performing endpoints
   - Implementation of caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Memory usage analysis and optimization

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-3 months)

1. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement comprehensive logging strategy
   - Add metrics collection for business operations
   - Set up alerting for critical system events

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Expand integration test coverage
   - Implement contract testing for API compatibility
   - Add performance benchmarks for critical paths

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation with examples
   - Create deployment and operations guide
   - Document system architecture and design decisions

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **API Evolution Strategy**
   - Maintain v1 endpoints for backward compatibility
   - Gradually migrate clients to v2 endpoints
   - Plan for v1 deprecation after 6 months of v2 stability

2. **Database Access Pattern**
   - Continue using Spring Data JDBC over JPA for simplicity
   - Implement custom queries for complex operations
   - Use DTO projections for read-only operations to reduce overhead

3. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Standardize error response format across all APIs
   - Implement proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
   - Add detailed error information for development environments

### Technology Decisions

1. **Notification Processing**
   - Use outbox pattern for reliable notification delivery
   - Implement asynchronous processing with retry mechanisms
   - Track notification delivery status for monitoring

2. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Continue with Telegram-based authentication
   - Implement token refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Prioritize integration tests over unit tests for business logic
   - Use TestContainers for database-dependent tests
   - Implement contract testing for API compatibility

## Important Patterns

### Code Organization Patterns

1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Clear separation between controllers, services, and repositories
   - Use of interfaces for service layer to enable testing
   - Consistent package structure across modules

2. **DTO Mapping Strategy**
   - Use MapStruct for type-safe mapping between layers
   - Separate DTOs for requests and responses
   - Immutable DTOs using records where appropriate

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Repository interfaces extending Spring Data JDBC
   - Custom queries using @Query annotation
   - Projection interfaces for read-only operations

### Design Patterns in Use

1. **Outbox Pattern**
   - Ensures reliable notification delivery
   - Decouples business operations from notification sending
   - Provides transactional guarantees for critical operations

2. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Used in notification handling for different notification types
   - Enables easy extension of notification strategies
   - Supports runtime selection of notification handling logic

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used in creating different types of notifications
   - Centralizes object creation logic
   - Enables easy addition of new notification types
