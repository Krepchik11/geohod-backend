   - ⏳ Database query optimization for slow endpoints
   - ⏳ Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
   - ⏳ Memory usage optimization

### Medium-term Tasks

1. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - ⏳ Implement comprehensive logging strategy
   - ⏳ Add custom metrics for business operations
   - ⏳ Set up alerting for critical system events

2. **Documentation**
   - ⏳ Complete API documentation with examples
   - ⏳ Create deployment and operations guide
   - ⏳ Document system architecture and design decisions

3. **Advanced Features**
   - ⏳ Event recommendation system
   - ⏳ Advanced search and filtering
   - ⏳ Event analytics and reporting

## Current Status

### Development Status
- **Phase**: Active development
- **API Version**: v2 (primary), v1 (legacy - maintained for compatibility)
- **Last Major Release**: v2.0.0
- **Current Sprint**: Focus on v2 API completion and performance optimization

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: ~65% (target: 80%)
- **API Documentation**: 70% complete
- **Performance**: Meeting SLA for 95% of requests
- **Bug Count**: 3 open issues (all minor)

### Deployment Status
- **Production**: Stable, running v2.0.0
- **Staging**: Testing new features
- **Development**: Active feature development

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
- None

### Major Issues
- None

### Minor Issues
1. **Performance**
   - Some database queries are slower than expected under load
   - Memory usage increases gradually over time (potential memory leak)

2. **API Consistency**
   - Some v1 endpoints have different error response formats than v2
   - Pagination implementation varies between endpoints

3. **Documentation**
   - Some v2 endpoints lack comprehensive examples
   - Deployment guide needs updating for new Docker setup

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution

1. **API Versioning Strategy**
   - **Initial Decision**: Single API version
   - **Evolution**: Implemented v1/v2 separation for backward compatibility

   - **Future Direction**: Plan for v1 deprecation after 6 months of v2 stability

2. **Data Access Pattern**
   - **Initial Decision**: Spring Data JPA
   - **Evolution**: Switched to Spring Data JDBC for simplicity
   - **Current State**: Using Spring Data JDBC with custom queries
   - **Future Direction**: Continue with JDBC, consider query optimization

3. **Notification System**
   - **Initial Decision**: Synchronous notification delivery
   - **Evolution**: Implemented outbox pattern for reliability
   - **Current State**: Asynchronous processing with retry mechanism
   - **Future Direction**: Add more notification channels and types

### Technology Evolution
