# Active Context: Review System Enhancements

## Current Focus

The current focus was on enhancing the review system to enforce one-to-one user-to-event reviews and provide an API endpoint to retrieve a user's existing review for an event.

## Recent Changes

*   Implemented a database unique constraint to prevent duplicate reviews.
*   Updated the `submitReview` method in `ReviewServiceImpl` to implement upsert logic.
*   Added a new API endpoint `GET /api/v2/reviews/event/{eventId}/my-review` in `ReviewController`.
*   Implemented the `getUserReviewForEvent` method in `ReviewServiceImpl`.
*   The keyset pagination fix has been successfully implemented and tested.

## Next Steps

1.  Review the newly updated Memory Bank files for accuracy and completeness.
2.  Begin work on any active development tasks, using the Memory Bank as a guide.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   The project is a well-structured Spring Boot application with a clear separation of concerns.
*   The reliance on Telegram for authentication is a critical and unique feature.
*   The use of `spring-data-jdbc` over `spring-data-jpa` is a significant architectural decision, suggesting a preference for more direct SQL control.
*   The system includes advanced patterns like the Outbox pattern for reliable notifications.
*   The review system now enforces one-to-one user-to-event reviews and provides an API endpoint to retrieve a user's existing review for an event.
