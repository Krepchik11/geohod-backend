# Active Context: Initial Project Analysis

## Current Focus

The current task is to populate the Memory Bank for the Geohod backend project. This involves analyzing the existing codebase to create a set of core documentation files that will guide future development.

## Recent Changes

*   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the following files:
    *   `projectBrief.md`: High-level project overview.
    *   `productContext.md`: The "why" behind the project.
    *   `techContext.md`: The technology stack and technical details.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: The application's architecture and design patterns.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the `progress.md` file to document the current state of the project from a development perspective.
2.  Review the newly created Memory Bank files for accuracy and completeness.
3.  Begin work on any active development tasks, using the Memory Bank as a guide.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   The project is a well-structured Spring Boot application with a clear separation of concerns.
*   The reliance on Telegram for authentication is a critical and unique feature.
*   The use of `spring-data-jdbc` over `spring-data-jpa` is a significant architectural decision, suggesting a preference for more direct SQL control.
*   The system includes advanced patterns like the Outbox pattern for reliable notifications.
