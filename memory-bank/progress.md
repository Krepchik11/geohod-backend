# Project Progress: Geohod Backend

## What Works

Based on the initial analysis of the codebase and `README.md`, the following core features are implemented and appear to be functional:

*   **Event Management API**: Full CRUD operations for events.
*   **Event Participation API**: Endpoints for registering, unregistering, and managing event participants.
*   **Reviews & Ratings API (v2)**: Functionality for submitting and managing user reviews and ratings.
*   **Notification System (v2)**: A notification system with API endpoints for fetching and dismissing notifications.
*   **Telegram Authentication**: A custom security filter is in place to handle authentication via Telegram.
*   **Database Migrations**: Liquibase is set up to manage the database schema.
*   **API Documentation**: Swagger UI and OpenAPI documentation are generated for the `dev` profile.
*   **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow is in place for automated deployment.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Feature Gaps**: A detailed feature review against product requirements is needed to identify any gaps.
*   **Testing**: While testing infrastructure (`spring-boot-starter-test`, `testcontainers`) is present, the extent and coverage of existing tests are unknown. A thorough code review is needed to assess test quality and identify areas that need more coverage.
*   **Admin/Moderation Tools**: There may be a need for more advanced administrative tools, such as user management or content moderation, which are not immediately apparent from the API.

## Current Status

*   The project is in a mature state, with a well-defined architecture and a significant number of features already implemented.
*   The Memory Bank has been initialized, providing a baseline for future development and onboarding.

## Known Issues & Blockers

*   No known issues at this time. A deeper dive into the code and testing will be required to uncover any potential bugs or technical debt.
