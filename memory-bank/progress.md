# Project Progress: Geohod Backend

## What Works

Based on the initial analysis of the codebase and `README.md`, the following core features are implemented and appear to be functional:

*   **Event Management API**: Full CRUD operations for events.
*   **Event Participation API**: Endpoints for registering, unregistering, and managing event participants.
*   **Reviews & Ratings API (v2)**: Functionality for submitting and managing user reviews and ratings.
*   **Notification System (v2)**: A notification system with API endpoints for fetching and dismissing notifications.
*   **Telegram Authentication**: A custom security filter is in place to handle authentication via Telegram.
*   **Database Migrations**: Liquibase is set up to manage the database schema.
*   **API Documentation**: Swagger UI and OpenAPI documentation are generated for the `dev` profile.
*   **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow is in place for automated deployment.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Feature Gaps**: A detailed feature review against product requirements is needed to identify any gaps.
*   **Testing**: While testing infrastructure (`spring-boot-starter-test`, `testcontainers`) is present, the extent and coverage of existing tests are unknown. A thorough code review is needed to assess test quality and identify areas that need more coverage.
*   **Admin/Moderation Tools**: There may be a need for more advanced administrative tools, such as user management or content moderation, which are not immediately apparent from the API.

## Current Status

*   **Memory Bank Updated:** Successfully updated the Memory Bank to reflect the completion of the keyset pagination fix for the notification processors and the review system enhancements.
*   **Bug Fix Completed:** Successfully resolved the critical bug where in-app and Telegram-bot notifications were not being delivered due to flawed `UUID` ordering in event log processing.
*   **Keyset Pagination Implemented:** Replaced the non-sequential `UUID` cursor with a composite `(createdAt, id)` cursor for reliable event log processing.
*   **Database Migration:** Added Liquibase migration `db.changelog-1.7-keyset-pagination-fix.xml` to support the new cursor structure.
*   **Code Changes:** Updated `EventLogServiceImpl`, `NotificationProcessorProgressServiceImpl`, `InAppNotificationProcessor`, `TelegramNotificationProcessor`, and corresponding tests to use the new cursor logic.
*   **Build Status:** All compilation errors have been resolved.
*   **Review System Enhancements**: Implemented one-to-one user-to-event reviews and provided an API endpoint to retrieve a user's existing review for an event.

## Known Issues & Blockers

*   **No Known Issues:** The keyset pagination fix and review system enhancements have been successfully implemented and tested. No known issues or blockers remain.
